# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models

This project provides code, data, and instructions for fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) using custom datasets. The goal is to adapt the model to specific tasks or domains by training it on task-specific data.

### Project Overview

This repository fine-tunes a pre-trained language model (such as GPT, RoBERTa) on custom datasets to improve performance on specific tasks. Fine-tuning can help the model provide more accurate responses, adapt to specialized vocabularies, or improve accuracy in particular domains.

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- GPU (recommended for large models)
- Dependencies:
  - PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on model choice)
  - Hugging Face Transformers library
  - Other dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rodridu/Finetune-LLMs.git
   cd Finetune-LLMs

2. **Install Dependencies**:
Install the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
Create an `.env` file or set environment variables if needed (e.g., for API keys or model paths).
